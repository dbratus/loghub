Puts a list of entries to a log.

In this mode loghub reads stdin line by line parsing each line as a JSON of the following format:

{
	"Sev": <severity>   //Number [0, 255]
	"Src": <log source> //String
	"Msg": <message>    //String
}

Each line must represent exactly one log entry.

The -addr parameter must specify an address of a log, not hub.

Using of -trust flag in production mode should be avoided. This flag opens the log to the "men in the middle" attack.
