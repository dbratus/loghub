Manages user roles.

This command creates or updates a user overriding its list of roles. Each roles enables access to a number of loghub actions.

The following roles are supported:

* reader: get, pass
* writer: put, pass
* admin: get, truncate, stat, user, pass

Using of -trust flag in production mode should be avoided. This flag opens the log to the "men in the middle" attack.
