Fetches logs from a log or hub.

The -src parameter is a comma separated list of regexps specifying the log sources which must be included into the result. If -src is not specified, all log sources are included.

The -range specifies a time range relative to -base. To get entries before -base, negative -range should be specified.

The -range must be a Go duration string: "A duration string is a possibly signed sequence of decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as "300ms", "-1.5h" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h"."

Using of -trust flag in production mode should be avoided. This flag opens the log to the "men in the middle" attack.
