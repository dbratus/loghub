Truncates a log or hub.

The -lim specifies a duration relative to the current moment before which entries are to be removed. For example, to remove all entries older than a day, specify -24h.

The -lim must be a Go duration string: "A duration string is a possibly signed sequence of decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as "300ms", "-1.5h" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h"."

Using of -trust flag in production mode should be avoided. This flag opens the log to the "men in the middle" attack.
