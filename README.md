# Welcome to LogHub!

Some systems in test environments log a lot. The more system is distributed, the more likely it will become difficult to obtain and analyze the logs from different sources on different hosts. Some agents may log more than others, some may require to log to a remote destination because their own hosts have no sufficient disk space to keep their logs.

LogHub is intended to 

* Allow agents to log locally if possible, so that the local storage of the agent hosts is used to store the logs by default.
* Allow automatic redistribution of the log data among hosts with respect to their storage capacity.
* Provide tools with a single endpoint for querying the logs as if they were a large single log.
